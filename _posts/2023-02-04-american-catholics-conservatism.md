## Catholics Must Shake Up or Shake Off American Conservatism

Political affiliations are impossible for a Catholic in America. Whoever says otherwise has likely
not pondered the implications. 

<br>

The indignant voices on the right rile us up by promising punishment and admonishing sinners
but say little about compassion or mercy. The seemingly compassionate voices on the left move
us towards love of neighbor unless that neighbor makes a politically incorrect statement. Then
they’re canceled. No path to redemption. Two viewpoints, same outcome: virtue signaling now
matters more than virtue. 

<br>

Impossible as the choice may be, many put their faith in the right and the promise that
traditional values and the sanctity of life will be protected. Make no mistake, if Jesus Christ is
your savior, the American right probably isn’t.

<br>

The political crisis of American conservatism is on full display for American Catholics. The
interests and strategies of the right are more and more at odds with the values that the Church
teaches. How can we possibly balance virtues like humility, charity, and compassion with the
politics of extremism and vilification?

<br>

Just last week, we saw many reactions to the statements of Pope Francis that homosexuality is
not a crime and his criticism of laws that punish homosexuality. “First we need to distinguish
between sins and crimes,” [he said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_fwQjrGdS0). The [outrage](https://www.newsweek.com/pope-francis-condemning-gay-marriage-restrictions-highlights-catholic-civil-war-1776606) that unsurprisingly followed in Catholic social
media feels more aligned with American political conservatism than it is with Catholic moral
teachings.

For decades, the ideological right has been ignoring the mismatch between what we find
morally correct and what is fixable with legislation, all the while turning a blind eye to the
actual social and moral teachings of Christ when it comes to our treatment of others. It wants
to be tough on crime when the very reason for re-incidence is that the [criminal justice system
needs reform](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/05/the-conservative-case-for-criminal-justice-reform) so it can truly rehabilitate people. It rallies behind political wins that aim at
putting women and doctors in jail for abortion yet [doesn’t have real power to end](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/a-guide-to-abortion-laws-by-state) it while
opposing [social policies](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/07/family-leave-conservatives/594838/) that could actually give expectant mothers a choice. Someone had to
break it to us: sins are not the same as crimes and we can’t force people to agree with us by
threatening punishment. 

<br>

The politics of anger and outrage is polluting and infiltrating our approach to dealing with
disagreements even within the Church. More and more we are being shaped by an “us vs
them&quot; mentality in how we see our fellow Catholics and even our leaders. The pontificate of

<br>

Pope Francis has provided many opportunities to see the viewpoints and tactics of political
conservatism permeating American Catholicism. 
This is not the first time that Pope Francis startles right-wing sympathizers. There were cries to
deny communion to Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi and when the Holy Father [did not support it](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/14/world/europe/biden-vatican-communion-abortion.html),
many American bishops [pretended not to hear him](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-catholic-bishops-brawl-over-denying-joe-biden-communion). The politics of outrage was too big a
temptation. Dining with sinners and tax collectors is not nearly as thrilling as flipping tables in
the temple. 

<br>

Pope Francis has asked us Catholics to [ditch the Tridentine latin mass](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/16/world/europe/pope-francis-old-latin-mass.html) TLM to promote unity in
the church, a unity [sought after by his predecessors](https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/18/world/john-paul-stresses-priestly-obedience.html). The backlash has been so antagonistic that
the TLM is being reduced to a political statement, willingly or unwillingly, by those who protest by attempting to [revive
a tradition](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/15/us/latin-mass-revival.html) that was only kept in less than 0.003% of masses in America. Obedience and humility
are easy to wash away in the thrill of outrage and reactionary politics which are increasingly
ingrained in American conservatism and apparently stronger than our values as Catholic
Christians. 

<br>

> ### "Wake up, right-wingers! Compassion _is_ righteousness!"

<br>

The statement about homosexuality is not surprising for anyone familiar with the [teachings of
the Church](https://www.usccb.org/sites/default/files/flipbooks/catechism/568/), but it is outrageous to those who act as if compassion will stain their righteousness. Wake up, right-wingers! Compassion is righteousness! The stir caused by Pope Francis's call for
love of neighbor, even a neighbor who the Church may consider sinful, is only a symptom. The
disease is not a disconnect between the Vatican and American conservatives, but between the
American right and our true Christian values.

<br>

The allegiance to the American right is changing us. In the fight over whether the Pope is too
liberal or whether we are called to [righteous anger](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/anger-is-a-calling/?amp) more than [mercy and compassion](https://www.forcey.org/media/blog/the-role-of-righteous-anger-in-christians/), we are
inflicting real damage to our Church by mimicking the [politics of polarization](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Why-Were-Polarized/Ezra-Klein/9781476700366). Every kingdom
divided against itself is laid waste, and no city or house divided against itself will stand.
Matthew 12:25. This ideological conflict is wasting our resources and hurting our mission to go
and make disciples of all nations by hurting the Church&#39;s standing and diverting our attention. 

<br>

“What is also a sin is the lack of charity to others. How are you doing with that?” Pope Francis
said. [He also spoke of God’s generous Mercy](https://www.youtube.com/live/TtIkOs7pHlE?feature=share&t=2526). “Think about the prodigal son. If we preached
more about that and not about silly things, we would be better off.'

<br>


But the right has too much to lose from allowing Christians to consider compassion. Lest we
remember that we are all sinners and that sinners are also people. We are to be kept angry,
loud, and self-righteous, like the Pharisees who loved the law but hated Jesus, so conservatism
can survive the storms of facts and the threat that is redemption and forgiveness. As Catholic
Cristians, we can still revert this trend and allow our values to permeate our society instead of
allowing it to change us.

<br>

We are called to have faith in God, not politics. Catholic Americans who want to do both will
continue to compromise on their values and bring divisiveness to the Church until we start to 
change. It is time for us to redefine our stance on politics instead of becoming pawns in the
game and to confront our supposed allies about what Christian values should truly champion. 
To follow Christ’s call to love our neighbor by doing more than threatening to punish them or
“praying for them to see the way”, we need to show [fraternity and compassion](https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20201003_enciclica-fratelli-tutti.html) for those on the
fringes of society as well as to those within the Church.

<br>

I thought that conservative values would align with my faith rather than compromise it. I
thought we were above the spectacle but really, we are complicit. Today we are quick to judge,
tolerate bigotry, and accuse our enemies of being anti-Catholic or worse. Today the uber-
conservatives don’t even blink before calling the head of Christ’s Church a heretic if he
disagrees with them and signs of open antisemitism are starting to infiltrate our Church. Watch
out, Jesus. If Catholics don’t take a stand soon, the American right might just come after you
next.
