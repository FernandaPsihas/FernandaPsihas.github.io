I'm a Catholic, a particle phycisist, and a <br>
Theology enthusiast. <br>

Blogging is vulnerable and it feels egotistical, <br>
but outspokenness is a value that is worth embracing.  <br>
No claims of brilliance here, just honesty.   <br>

Thoughts about religion, science, society, and whatever  <br>
else relates to the current object of my hyperfocus.
