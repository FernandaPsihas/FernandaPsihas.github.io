I am a particle phycisist and an aspiring theologian. 

Blogging is vulnerable and it feels egotistical, but outspokenness is a value that is worth modeling. No claims of brilliance here, just honesty.  

Thoughts about religion, science, society, and whatever else relates to the current object of my hyperfocus.
